		<p>Judging from Shenzhen’s socialist reform plan from 2020 to 2025 and President’s Xi Jinping’s delineation of the role of Shenzhen in China’s economic development, the special economic zone is designated as an economic locomotive not only playing a role model for the entire People’s Republic of China (PRC), but also leading Macau and Hong Kong in the deeper socio-economic integration of the Greater Bay Area (GBA).</p>
		
		<p>The socialist reform plan published by the Central Office of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council repositions Shenzhen as the economic locomotive in the PRC and GBA in several key aspects.</p>
		
		<p>First, Shenzhen is portrayed as a “core engine” in “the construction of the GBA and the establishment of urban cities in the process of socialist modernization” of the PRC, which is becoming a “great power.”</p>
		
		<p>Second, marketization is to be deepened and accelerated in Shenzhen, where innovative enterprises in the stock market are to be experimented, the People’s Bank digital currencies will be promoted, a digital privacy system is to be established, and where a government database for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau platform will be shared.</p>
		
		<p>In short, the plan sets out a five-year blueprint for Shenzhen to achieve the aforesaid objectives, using 2022 as a mid-point for all aspects to promote deeper and faster reforms. The main idea is to make Shenzhen as “a high quality and a new developmental high ground,” with radiative impacts on entire China.</p>
